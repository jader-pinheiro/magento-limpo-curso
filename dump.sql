When you use our store services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. When you share information with us, we can make our services even better for you. For instance, we can show you more relevant search results and ads, help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. Remember, you can find controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and security. We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-2\">Right to access, correct and delete data and to object to data processing</dt>\r\n    <dd>Our customers have the right to access, correct and delete personal data relating to them, and to object to the processing of such data, by addressing a written request, at any time. The Company makes every effort to put in place suitable precautions to safeguard the security and privacy of personal data, and to prevent it from being altered, corrupted, destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, the Company does not control each and every risk related to the use of the Internet, and therefore warns the Site users of the potential risks involved in the functioning and use of the Internet. The Site may include links to other web sites or other internet sources. As the Company cannot control these web sites and external sources, the Company cannot be held responsible for the provision or display of these web sites and external sources, and may not be held liable for the content, advertising, products, services or any other material available on or from these web sites or external sources.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-2\">Management of personal data</dt>\r\n    <dd>You can view or edit your personal data online for many of our services. You can also make choices about our collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which services you use. You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from our store by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by visiting and signing into Company Promotional Communications Manager, which allows you to update contact information, manage contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with our partners. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain store services.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-2\">Information We Collect</dt>\r\n    <dd>Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the services and features you use.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-2\">How We Use Your Information</dt>\r\n    <dd>Our store uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send communications, including promotional communications, and to display advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various store services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.</dd>\r\n    <dt class=\"heading-2\">Sharing Your Information</dt>\r\n    <dd>We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. In addition, we share personal data among our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we\'ve hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.</dd>\r\n</dl>','2016-03-12 02:24:45','2017-01-06 10:46:51',1,0,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(6,'Customer Service','1column','','','customer-service','Customer Service','<div class=\"customer-service\">\r\n    <div class=\"text-block customer-service__block\">\r\n        <h3>Delivery</h3>\r\n        <h4>Hello and welcome to the shipping and delivery information page!

Insecurity? Fear? Lack of confidence? All of the above? How can you overcome these obstructions?</p>\r\n<p>Your Mantras</p>\r\n<p>You may be wondering if you have the necessary skills, time, connections, and a million other things in order to create the business of your dreams. If you let your uncertainty and insecurity overpower you, you won\'t ever be able to unleash your true business potential. To unlock the positive forces of your creativity and drive that will yield amazing results, make these your mantras:</p>\r\n<p>\'\'I will abandon all negative thoughts that prevent me from realizing my business objectives.\'\'\r\n\'\'I will focus my energy on growing the business of my dreams.\'\'</p>\r\n<p> A Dreamer and a Doer</p>\r\n<p>It is important to take time to develop your vision and your practical thinking should be geared to this vision. You need to work with conviction. Being a dreamer does not mean that you can\'t also be a doer. In fact, having a dream is the starting point for building your dream business. The problem starts when you stop there instead of setting realizable immediate targets. Success cannot come from one day to the next. So you need to build your dream business bit by bit. When your dreams begin to be transformed into reality thanks to your actions, you become aware of the power you possess for catalyzing success; and this further strengthens your determination to reach every single one of your business goals.</p>\r\n<p>Make It Happen</p>\r\n<p>Nothing can happen without tenacity, fortitude, and courage. Be bold enough to make choice  don\'t just let things happen to you. Though you cannot have control over everything, you can focus on what you can handle and influence with your actions in a given situation. You have the power to make decisions that will move your business forward. You should not feel daunted by your lack of knowledge of business strategies either. You learn and grow while building your business. No women entrepreneur/mompreneur possesses absolute knowledge; there are so many examples of hugely successful businesswomen who started out without having any clue about business promotion techniques. Their motivation to learn, their unwavering belief that they could create the business of their dreams, and their steadfastness were key factors for their success.</p>','What is stopping you from believing in the business of your dreams?

Founded in 1952, it supplies mostly handmade bicycles for the road, track and cyclo-cross. The company also produces bicycles under the Opera brand name, and has an in-house component brand – MOST.\r\n\r\nIn December 2016, the company was acquired by L Catterton, a private equity group associated with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, better known as LVMH.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Pinarello was born in Catena di Villorba, Italy in 1922. He was the eighth of 12 brothers. At the age of fifteen, Giovanni began making bicycles at the factory of Paglianti. After a successful amateur career he turned professional in 1947, aged 25.Pinarello died on 4 September 2014.\r\n\r\nThe Pinarello Montello SLX was a landmark model for Pinarello as this was the frame with which Pinarello achieved their first major pro victories. This model frame was one of the most responsive of the mid to late 1980s as shown by wins in events such as the 1984 Summer Olympics Road Race, Vuelta a España, the Giro d\'Italia and stages of the Tour de France. The Montello had a brake cable through the top tube, chrome sloping front forks and chrome on the drive side chain stay; later models had the full rear triangle chromed. The Montello SLX was in red, blue and Spumoni. Pinarellos from the mid-1980s often have the decals restored by collectors as factory-applied decals where prone to flakeing off. The Montello was fabricated from Columbus SLX butted tubing with rifling down the inside center. The bottom bracket was investment cast with the Pinarello logo and the dropouts were by Campagnolo. Braze-ons for down-tube shifters, front derailleur and two water bottles were provided. The GPT logo (for Giovanni Pinarello, Treviso) appeared in many locations.','','',1),('5','Specialized',1,'specialized','Specialized','brand-5.png','a6bd9469ad9b0ac93ddd088927fef57b.png','brand-5.png','Specialized Bicycle Components, Inc., more commonly known simply as Specialized, is a major American manufacturer of high performance bicycles, bicycle components and related products.

The company was founded in 1974 by Mike Sinyard and is based in Morgan Hill, California.\r\nSpecialized was founded in 1974 by Mike Sinyard, a cycling enthusiast who sold his Volkswagen Bus for $1,500 to fund a cycle tour of Europe, where he bought handlebars and stems made by Cinelli to take back to the US. Sinyard started out importing Italian bike components that were difficult to find in the United States, but the company began to produce its own bike parts by 1976, starting with the Specialized Touring Tire. In 1981, the company introduced its first two bikes, the Sequoia, a sport-touring design and the Allez, a road bike. Specialized also introduced the first major production mountain bike in the world, the Stumpjumper, in 1981. Like the Sequoia and Allez, the Stumpjumper was designed by Tim Neenan and based on an early Tom Ritchey design. Specialized continues to produce bikes under the Stumpjumper name, including both hardtail and full-suspension models. An original Stumpjumper is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. In 1989, Specialized introduced the Epic, the world\'s second mass-production carbon fibre mountain bike.','','',1),('6','Haibike',1,'haibike','Haibike','brand-6.png','haibike3.png','brand-6.png','In 1995, Susanne and Felix Puello founded the brand Haibike.

Susanne is the CEO of Winora Group and great-granddaughter to the company founder, Engelbert Wiener. In the beginning these sporty bikes were still offered under the name of our parent brand Winora, but soon became Haibike. Over the next 15 years, the brand developed new models and further advanced both visually and technically.\r\nThe forefather of all eMTBs, the Haibike eQ XDURO is presented at Eurobike. The response is great right from the start: Never before has a manufacturer created a truly off-road suitable eMTB. Haibike’s turned motor concept and the initial design will be copied multiple times in the future. The initial range consists of four models (Fully, Hardtail, Cross and Trekking). The demand exceeds the supply and the XDUROs sell out quickly. This is a turning point in our history.\r\nHaibike is using a special production process for the very first Xduro: Gravity Casting. This casting process originated from the motorcycle industry and makes it possible to produce complex components that are extremely stable and precise, but yet very lightweight. This technology is mainly used for our “interface,“ also known as the engine mount. This is the heart of the frame, where technical functions work together. This technology is used by more and more competitors later on.','','',1);
